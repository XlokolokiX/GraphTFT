# 📊 TFT Graphing Library (Under Development)

**A simple, easy-to-use library for graphing 2D data on TFT displays.**

This graphic library aims to simplify the creation of two-dimensional plots, similar to **Matplotlib**, but for **TFT displays**. Whether you're working with bar charts, line graphs, or other types of visual data, this library provides an intuitive interface to display your data directly on the TFT screen.

### ✨ Features:
- 🖥️ **TFT Display Graphing**: Effortlessly plot data points and create visualizations on TFT displays.
- 📚 **Built on TFT_eSPI**: Utilizes the powerful [TFT_eSPI library](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI) as a base.
- 📏 **Customizable Graphs**: Easily adjust graph size, style, and data scaling to suit your needs.
